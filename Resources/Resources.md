## Specific package documentation

- Most package informatino is hosted on their own website - for example, emotion is at https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction
- However, you can also check out their npm page and see if they have their documentation on there - for example, the emotion npm page: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@emotion/react

## General

- https://www.stackoverflow.com
    - Forum for people asking programming questions. If you're googling an error, this is probably where you'll end up anyway.

- https://chat.openai.com or any other chatbot
    - Keep in mind not to believe everything AI tells you.
    - Make sure you understand the code. As you're learning, nothing is worse than copying and pasting code from other sources if you don't understand it. If it gives you some code that you don't know, you can ask it to explain the code or try Googling it. This also applies to other code you copy from places like StackOverflow.

- Often, just Googling the error/problem is the best method

## Practice Sites
#### I would recommend only doing FrontendMentor once you've grasped the fundamentals of HTML/CSS, and Leetcode once you have the fundamentals of JavaScript logic

- https://www.frontendmentor.io - Web page challenges

- https://leetcode.com - Algorithms and problem solving

- https://www.codingame.com - A more gamified version of leetcode
