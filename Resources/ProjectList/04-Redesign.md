## Project 4: Website Redesign/Remake
Objective: Choose an existing website and redesign or remake it. Focus on improving the user interface, user experience, or adding new features.

As an example, redesign or remake Midland's website: https://www.midlandu.edu

### Requirements:
Select a website to redesign or remake. It could be a well-known site or a less popular one.

Analyze the original website:

Identify its key features and functionalities.

Note aspects of the design or user experience that could be improved.

Sketch a layout for the new design.

Decide which features to keep, remove, or add.

Create a new React application for the redesign.

Develop React components corresponding to the various parts of the website (e.g., header, footer, navigation bar, content sections).

Implement navigation and routing if the website has multiple pages.

Ensure the redesigned website is responsive and provides a good user experience on different devices.

Apply CSS and styling to match your new design.

### Bonus Challenges (Optional):
Add animations or transitions to enhance the user interface.

Implement a theme switcher to toggle between light and dark modes.

Integrate external APIs to add new functionalities not present in the original website.

Conduct user testing with others to gather feedback and make improvements.
