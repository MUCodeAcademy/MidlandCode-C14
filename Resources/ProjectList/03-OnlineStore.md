## Project 3: Fake Online Store

Objective: Create a mock online store resembling platforms like Amazon or eBay. The store should display products, allow users to add them to a cart, and view the cart.

Example: https://www.amazon.com

(Your store does not need to be nearly as complicated as Amazon's - you're just one person and Amazon has thousands of software engineers. Just make the product display and cart functionalities).

### Requirements:

Create a new React application.

Develop a ProductList component to display available products.

Each product should show an image, name, price, and an 'Add to Cart' button.

Implement a Product component for individual product details.

Create a Cart component to show items added to the cart.

Display the product name, price, and quantity for each item in the cart.

Implement functionality to remove items from the cart.

Initialize state to track products in the cart and total cart value.

Implement functionality to add products to the cart, including updating the total cart value.

Style the application to resemble an online store, ensuring responsiveness on various devices.

### Bonus Challenges (Optional):

Add a search feature to filter products by name or category.

Implement user authentication to simulate a login system.

Create a checkout process with a form to enter shipping information.

Integrate a mock payment system for educational purposes.
