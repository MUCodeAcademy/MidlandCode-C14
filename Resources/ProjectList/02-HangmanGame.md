## Project 2: Hangman Game

Objective: Build a Hangman game where players guess letters to form a word. The game is won if the word is correctly guessed before the player runs out of attempts.

Example: https://www.hangmanwords.com/play

### Requirements:

Create a new React application.

Develop a component to display the Hangman figure. Update the figure as the player makes incorrect guesses.

Create a component to display the word being guessed, with blanks representing unguessed letters.

Implement a keyboard component allowing players to select letters.

Initialize state to track guessed letters, correct guesses, and remaining attempts.

Implement game logic to check if a guessed letter is in the word.

If correct, reveal the letter in the word.

If incorrect, update the Hangman figure and decrease remaining attempts.

Display a message indicating a win if the word is correctly guessed, or a loss if attempts run out.

Style the game for a pleasant user experience and ensure responsiveness across devices.

### Bonus Challenges (Optional):

Allow the player to choose a difficulty level, which changes the number of attempts.

Implement a feature to randomly select words from a predefined list.

Add sound effects for correct and incorrect guesses, wins, and losses.

Create a score tracking system to keep track of wins and losses over multiple games.
