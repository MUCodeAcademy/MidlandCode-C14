## Project 5: Snake Game
Objective: Build the classic 'Snake' game using React. The player controls a snake to eat items on the screen, growing longer with each item, and must avoid colliding with the game boundaries or itself.

Example: https://playsnake.org

### Requirements:
Create a new React application.

Develop a GameBoard component to display the playing area.

Implement the snake using a series of connected segments.

Initialize state to track the position and length of the snake.

Create a mechanism to randomly place items on the GameBoard for the snake to eat.

Handle keyboard input to control the movement of the snake (up, down, left, right).

Update the snake's position based on the direction of movement.

Check for collisions with the game boundaries or the snake itself.

Handle the snake growing longer when it eats an item.

Update the score based on the number of items eaten.

Display the current score and high score.

Implement a game over scenario when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries.

Apply CSS to style the game, making it visually appealing and ensuring responsiveness across devices.

### Bonus Challenges (Optional):
Increase the difficulty as the score gets higher (e.g., faster snake speed).

Add different types of items with various effects (e.g., temporary speed boost).

Implement a pause and resume feature.

Create a leaderboard to track high scores.
