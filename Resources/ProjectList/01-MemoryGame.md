## Project 1: Memory Game

Objective: Create a memory game using React, where players flip cards to find pairs. The game ends when all pairs are found.

Example: https://www.helpfulgames.com/subjects/brain-training/memory.html

### Requirements:

Create a new React application.

Design a grid layout to display 9 cards in a 3x3 grid (you can add more cards if you want).

Create a Card component that represents each card in the game.

Each card should have two states: flipped and unflipped.

Display a placeholder image or color for unflipped cards.

Initialize a state to track the flipped status of each card.

Implement a function to flip a card when clicked.

Ensure that no more than two cards can be flipped at once.

Implement logic to check if two flipped cards are a match.

If they match, keep them flipped and visually indicate the match.

If they don't match, flip them back over after a short delay.

Track the number of matches found.

Display a message when all pairs are matched, signifying the end of the game.

Apply CSS to make the game visually appealing.

Ensure the game is responsive and looks good on various screen sizes.

### Bonus Challenges (Optional):

Add a timer to track how long it takes to match all pairs.

Implement a restart button to reset the game.

Randomize the positions of the cards at the start of each game.
