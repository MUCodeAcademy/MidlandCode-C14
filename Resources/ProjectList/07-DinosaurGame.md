## Project 7: Dinosaur Run Game Remake
Objective: Remake Google Chrome's "Dinosaur Run" game. The game activates when offline in Chrome, featuring a dinosaur that jumps over obstacles.

Example: https://dinosaur-game.io

### Requirements:
Create a new React application.

Develop the main game view, displaying a ground line and a score counter.

Implement a Dinosaur component that the player controls.

Enable the dinosaur to jump in response to a key press (e.g., space bar or up arrow).

Create Obstacle components that move from right to left across the screen.

Initialize state to manage the spawning and movement of obstacles.

Implement collision detection logic between the dinosaur and obstacles.

Track and display the score based on the duration the player survives without colliding.

Implement a game over scenario when the dinosaur collides with an obstacle.

Display a game over message and the player's score.

Style the game to resemble the Google Chrome version, ensuring responsiveness on different devices.

### Bonus Challenges (Optional):

Add different types of obstacles, varying in size and speed.

Implement a day-night cycle, changing the background and obstacle colors.

Add a feature to duck the dinosaur under low-flying obstacles.

Create a system to gradually increase the game's difficulty as the score gets higher.
