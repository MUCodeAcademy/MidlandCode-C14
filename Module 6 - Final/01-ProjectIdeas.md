### Final Group Project Ideas

Pick one of these projects below to build for your final project:

### 1. Battleship
- Battleship is a strategic guessing game where players aim to sink each other's fleet by guessing their locations on a grid. The game development will require designing a grid-based system, managing player state data, implementing game rules for placing ships and attacking, and creating a multiplayer setup, possibly with real-time updates to reflect opponent's moves. If we have time, we could develop an AI for the players to play against.

### 2. Chess
- Chess is a two-player strategy board game where each player tries to checkmate their opponent's king. Developing this game involves implementing complex movement rules for each type of piece, detecting check and checkmate scenarios, and managing turn-based gameplay. Similarly to Battleship, we could develop an AI for the players to play against.

### 3. Text-based Adventure Game
- A text-based adventure game is an interactive story where players will form groups together to make choices that affect the outcome of the game. This project will involve creating a narrative-driven experience, where players navigate through a series of scenarios by reading text descriptions and making decisions based on the options provided. Development will include designing a branching storyline, websockets for players to join groups, implementing a system for tracking player decisions, and creating a world through detailed descriptions. Additionally, we could incorporate puzzles or challenges that players must solve to advance the story. If we have time, we can use WebGL or ASCII art to create pictures of the obstacles that players will face. This project will focus on creative writing, logical decision structures, and maintaining game state across different scenarios.
