# Classwork

Create a simple application that will allow us to chat with anyone else connected to it. We will need the following things to make it work:

- A backend to handle the sockets server side. We won't need an API or anything for this, so it's going to be fairly simple.
- A chat component that displays chat messages
- Ideally, a useSocket hook that will trigger the socket events

EXTRA:

- Allow users to login, and display their username when they send a message.
