# Classwork

- Implement cookies in the Giphy app that allows users to stay logged in once they're logged in.

EXTRA:
- Add a JWT that allows them to go to a certain page on your site only if they have that JWT.
- Create a 'cookie modal' that allows users to accept or reject cookies. If they click accept, they can keep/receive the cookie when they log in. If they reject cookies, clear their cookies and don't allow them to have any more.
