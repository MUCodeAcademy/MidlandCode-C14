# Personal React Project

This application should allow for you to display your React skills learned so far. Unlike the other projects we have been doing, this will be used to display both your creativity AND your talent. As a whole, the content is not as important as the functionality. Use this to flex your muscles and work on something you are passionate about. The more passionate you are about something you code, the better you can talk about it. All of that in mind, the project should have at least the following:

- Utilize a form with at least 4 inputs.
- Utilize routing.
- Utilize state management in some form, whether it's `useState`, `Context`, or any other option.
- Utilize some sort of animation. This can be one you have already done, but add at least one animation to the page.
- Feel free to utilize some sort of styling library like MUI or any other one you want.
- Follow best practices for separation of files and folder structure.
- Add a database for any information you need to store.
- Add at least one test. If you have extra time, feel free to add more.
- Challenge yourself.
- Utilize GitHub commits.

You'll be able to work on the project this week as well as next week, and the break.
