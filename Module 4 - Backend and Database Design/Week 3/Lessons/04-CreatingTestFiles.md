# Creating Tests

1. Create a `Tests` folder in the src directory.
2. Create a test for the file you want to test in that folder (example: LoginPage.test.js)
3. Once you've written that test, run `npm test` in the terminal.
4. Every time you save a test file, it will re-run all tests.

If you want to run a specific test instead of all of them, type `npm test FileName.test.js`.
