# Database Design

We'll be building a fictional database for an 'X' clone (the artist formerly known as Twitter). Think about how you can design interconnected tables. We're going to start basic with only the following needs (in no particular order):

1. 
TABLE

users

COLUMNS

user_id
username
password

2. 
TABLE

posts

COLUMNS

post_id
author
likes
replies
