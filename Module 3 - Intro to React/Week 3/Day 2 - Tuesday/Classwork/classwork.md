# Classwork

You can try to implement React Query instead of regular fetch requests or Axios. Other than that, continue working on finalizing the Giphy app.

To finish the functionality of our app, here's what's left:

1. Display the gifs to the page when they search for them.
2. Add the ability to favorite and unfavorite gifs. (Context file)
3. Display those on the favorites page.

If you've completed it, here are some optional things you can try:

1. Add a logout button
2. Try to save the user's favorites when they logout and log back in
    - This will be difficult to do, we'll learn better ways to do this in Module 5
3. Fully stylize it with styled components and/or a different library like MUI

## Optional
### Try to build another project

This does not have to be fully fleshed out - it's just a chance to get further practice.

Here's some ideas to practice:

- Use an external API that can be searched / queried by a user (try using React Query)
  - A good list of APIs that you might want to use can be found here: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
  - We will have a personal project next module where you'll pick an API, so if you have a favorite one, I'd save it for that project.
- Protected routes to allow the user to log in and/or sign up
- State management across the application
- Implementation of external libraries for styling (emotion, MUI, or any others you find)
- Proper structure of the application to allow for reusable hooks / components / etc.
