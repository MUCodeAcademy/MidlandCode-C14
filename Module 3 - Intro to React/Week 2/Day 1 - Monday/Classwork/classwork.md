# Classwork

Utilize the design practices we've already implemented and update the components you see fit to be styled components. Once you have that completed, try to implement MaterialUI in some places. Something to note is that MaterialUI isn't going to be used everywhere, and in most cases styled components would be used instead, so it's important to become familiar with those.

Feel free to add more functionality to the todo app if you want, like deleting tasks.
