# Classwork

Using what we currently know, we will be doing the following:

- Create a simple application that allows for a user to input a username and a title for a todo.
- Create a pre-built list of todos to start with.
- Display all of the pre-built todos to the page.
- When a user adds a todo, add that to the array of todos.
- Think about how clean you can make this with more specific components / usage knowing what you know now.
- Try adding sorting and/or filtering to the list of displayed todos.

Finish up the implementation for the todo app over the weekend. Don't worry too much about styling or making it look nice for now, we'll talk about some UI libraries next week that we can use for that.
